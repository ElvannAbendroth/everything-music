I remember harp technique to be so hard when I began to play, and now that I teach I see students struggle a lot with it too. There are just so many things to remember at once when you start, and I wish I had a list of them all when I started. That way I could have remembered In order to help beginner harpists with their technique, I have created this printable set of sheets to help you remind yourself of your technique when you play. The first pages go into details about the technical aspects of playing the harp, how to place your hands and how to articulate properly. The next section is a checklist for all of the technical aspects detailed earlier. This way, you can see everything you need to think about in a single page! I’ve also reserved a section for you to take notes, in case there are things you wish to add!

Use these sheets as a reference when you practice your arpeggios, scales & pieces! Enjoy! xxx

## Position

### Harp on the Shoulder

Bring the harp to you so it rests comfortably on your right shoulder. The weird shape of a harp becomes useful as it finds a gravity center between its resting position and it's playing position, which allows it to not be too heavy on your shoulder. Just make sure the position allows you to reach the pedals (if the harp has some), and always make sure you don't feel like it's going to either fall forward or feel too heavy on your shoulder.

### Thumbs Up

When placing your hand, you want to make sure your thumb stays high compared to the rest of the hand. We want to make sure it can close and open on its own at all times. If the hand gets too close, you'll be tempted to play the wrist instead, and that's not good!

### Round Hand + Parallel Fingers

The inside of your hand should be round and parallel to the strings. The position almost looks like holding a tea or a coffee mug in your hand (but with our thumb still up!).

### Play in the Middle of the Strings

When we play, we'll try to position ourselves in the center of the strings as much as possible.  Playing on a single line allows consistency,, but also, harps tend to have a richer & more resonant tone in this area. Keep the weird shape of the harp in mind when aiming for the center!

### Round Wrist + Following Elbow

We want to keep our wrists and arms slightly curved (a little bit like ballerinas). Distorted joints are very uncomfortable and could cause injuries. That fact implies when we'll want to play higher, we'll have to raise our elbows accordingly. This will help you keep that round wrist shape and stay comfortable.

## Articulation

### Thumb Always on Top

Your thumb should always close on top of the hand, whether he starts playing first or last (or anything in-between). It never should go under your other fingers or touch the palm of the hand. It should stay nicely on top of the hand. Having the thumb stuck under other fingers isn’t really a good idea when you try to play something.

### Fingers Touching the Palm

Fingers should “pop” from the string to the palm of the hand (or top if we're talking about our thumb) really quickly. It usually helps giving a nice tone to the harp, and will help you play louder. (Gotta hear that beautiful harp sound, heh?)

### Straight Articulation

The articulation should always come from the metacarpal-phalangeal joint of the hand. That means fingers should close with straight fingers rather than with them curled up. At the beginning, that might feel a little strange, and you might ring undesired strings in the process, but do your best to concentrate more on the technique than the sound when you start out. It's going to happen, and you'll quickly find a way to adjust your angle so you can avoid it.

### No Staggering Joints

As harpists, we want to have strong joints so we have as much control as possible on our tone and dynamics. We sure do not want the fingers to curl inside the hand, but we also do absolutely want to avoid the fingers’ joints to stagger. Make sure to stay aware of it when you practice, or they might be prevented from gaining the strength they need. to allow you a nice control of your tone and dynamics. (It also becomes pretty bothering when you try to play faster material, there's just no time to lose on staggery fingers!)

### Fingers Independency

Anytime you play a string, the rest of your hand should not move. We want the fingers to do the job on their own, and not have them go in all directions. This will end up being very confusing for you in the end. Try moving your fingers without moving the rest of the hand, and that exercise can be donewithout a harp too!

### Hand Stability + Compass

When playing the last string you attached, we want our hands to stay in place as much as possible. It’s tempting to use a twist of the wrist, or lose you hand angle and position, but preventing this from happening will definitely help you make better links between sections when you play. . This will also allow you to use your hand as a compass and will help you place it back on the next strings much quicker.

### Reopen Everything

Your hand should always finish as a closed fist when it leaves the harp, but as you place your fingers on new strings, always reopen the whole hand so it gets some time to breath. That removes unnecessary tensions, makes it more ready for unexpected things to happen, and is much more comfortable.
